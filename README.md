# Code Refactor Starter Code

I added comments to the index.html and style.css files to divide and label the content. 
Within the index.html file I changed multiple div elements to semantic html elements. 
In the style.css file I was able to consolidate multiple rules into one to reduce repeated code.
Due to adding semantic html, I was able to get rid of some classes to further consolidate the css file.
Added the appropriate id elements in order to create working links in the nav section of the header.
Added the required alt attributes to img elements.
Changed the file structure to remove the develop folder in order to deploy the site.
